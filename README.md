# FlashPoint
A free alternative for viewing and creating flashcards.<br>
This was a collaborative project. I was in charge of handling implementations of code handed in from the group and editing to make use of Springboot. <br>
## Tech/Framework used:

This project was built using the following technologies:

- Spring Boot
- Java
- Thymeleaf
- HTML
- CSS

# How to setup:
Using vscode, download the folder titled "serving-web-content." This will be the folder you will open in vscode, it will look similar to this once opened up: <br>
![Image of sidebar from VSCODE](/page_images/vscode_serving.png) <br>
From here, you will want to download all the springboot extensions, specifically the **Spring Boot Extension Pack**. You will also need Gradle or any other build system you prefer to run with Spring. <br>
Once that is all setup, you may start the project from the "Spring Boot Dashboard." On startup, you may navigate to: **http://localhost:8080**

# What can you do?
## Login
Initially, you will be greeted with a blank page saying for you to login. By clicking the login button, you will then be shown a login page: <br>
![Login page](/page_images/Login_Page.png) <br>

> [!Note]
> If you wish to use the admin account, instead of creating an account you may skip this section.
> The username and pass for the admin account is as follows:
> Username: admin
> Password: pass

## Creating an account
By clicking the create account button, you will be taken to this page: <br>
![Create account page](/page_images/Create_Account_Page.png) <br>
There are certain criterias needed when creating a password/username, if they are not met or interfere with current accounts, you will have a warning pop up. <br>
Once the account is created, you will not have any subjects or flashcards to view and will need to create them manually.

## Subjects
Once you are logged in you will be presented with a list of flashcard subjects. If you do not have any, you can create some using the "Add Subject" button. <br>

## Flashcards
To view the flashcards under a subject, just click the subject card and a list of flashcards will be shown if any have been created. <br>
![flashcards page](/page_images/flashcards_page.png) <br>
From here, you can click on each card to flip them, a small animation will play showing the description/the back of the card. <br>

### Adding, Editing, and Deleting Subjects/flashcards
Whenever you are looking at a subject or flashcard, there are two buttons, <br>
- **-** button will delete a card with a warning beforehand. <br>
- **âœŽ** button will allow you to edit the card.<br>
To **add** a subject, you can click "Add Subject" the page will then update and show:
![Edit subject page](/page_images/Edit_Subject_Page.png) <br>
Here, the inside the text box will show what is currently the subject. You can either edit it or leave it how it is then click "Submit." <br> <br>
To **add** a flashcard, you can click "Add Flashcard" the page will update and show:
![Edit flashcard page](/page_images/Editing_flashcard_page.png) <br>
Here, each textbox will show what is currently in the topic or description for the flashcard. You can either edit it or leave it and click "Submit" once you are done. The page will then update and showcase your new (or same) flashcard.

## Games
Whenever you are viewing a subject, the taskbar will contain 2 games. "Knowledge Tower" and "Memory Match." Each game uses your current flashcards to help you study. <br>
### Knowledge Tower
Here is what the Knowledge Tower will look like:<br>
![Knowledge Tower](/page_images/Knowledge_Tower_page.png) <br>
Flaschards are randomized and as you answer correctly, you will gain blocks. After 3 incorrect tries the tower will fall over. Additionally, your highest score will be stored per flashcard set so you can continue improving in each set. The more cards you have, the better the experience, as it will make it more difficult on you to remember and learn every card.
> [!NOTE]
> An XP system was being added, at the moment, it has not been completed as I wanted it to fully save as ranks and XP were unique to a set.

# How everything is saved
In the begininng of this project, I did not have knowledge in using a database to store data. As a result, a simple txt file was used and formatted to be read and written to. <br>
Whenever any change is made, whether it be an account is made, a card is deleted or editted, or a new highscore is met, the file will be updated. Using Spring Boot requests are sent to the txt file to update it.<br>
On **Startup** the txt file is loaded and read and using GET/POST methods all functions can be properly done in the most efficient way.
