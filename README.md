This was a collaborative project. I was in charge of handling implementations of code handed in from the group and editing to make use of Springboot. <br>
## Tech/Framework used:

This project was built using the following technologies:

- Spring Boot
- Java
- Thymeleaf
- HTML
- CSS

## How to setup:
Using vscode, download the folder titled "serving-web-content". This will be the folder you will open in vscode, it will look similar to this once opened up: <br>
![Image of sidebar from VSCODE](/page_images/vscode_serving.png) <br>
From here, you will want to download all the springboot extensions, specifically the **Spring Boot Extension Pack**. You will also need Gradle or any other build system you prefer to run with Spring. <br>
Once that is all setup, you may start the project from the "Spring Boot Dashboard". On startup, you may navigate to: **http://localhost:8080**

## What can you do?
Initially, you will be greeted with a blank page saying for you to login. By clicking the login button, you will then be shown a login page: <br>

There are certain criterias needed when creating a password/username, if they are not met or interfere with current accounts, you will have a warning pop up.
